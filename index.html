        <p>
            Welcome to my Portfolio! Here I share a brief description of my story, as well as showcase my current activities, projects, and more. 
            Thank you for visiting my page!
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m a rising at UW Seattle pursuing a Bachelor's electrical and computer engineering and taking as many computer science classes that I can fit into my 
            schedule alongside my engineering curriculum. As a highly motivated self-learner with a keen interest in pioneering and building the technology 
            of the future, I’m always striving to expand my breadth of knowledge and experience through research, personal projects, and elective classes. 
            Looking forward, I'm applying to UW ECE's BSMS program where I'll spend the 2025-2026 academic year pursuing a Master's in electrical and computer eningeering 
            with a concentration in AI. When it's time to enter the work force, I aspire to be a software engineer working on distributed systems, LLMs, high performance 
            computing.
